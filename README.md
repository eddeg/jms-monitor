Description: A full-stack application for managing JMS (Java Message Service) connections and messages, providing a user-friendly interface for both consumers and producers.

Installation:
The mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/java image typically contains a JDK, Maven, Node.js, Git, curl, wget, and python.  Using a pre-built image is often faster and more efficient.  No Dockerfile is required if an image is specified.

Technology Stack:
1. Backend:
   - Java 17
   - Spring Boot 2.7.9
   - Spring Data MongoDB
   - Spring for Apache ActiveMQ 5
   - Lombok
   - SpringFox (Swagger) for API documentation
   - JUnit 5 and Mockito for testing

2. Frontend:
   - Vue.js 3
   - Vuex for state management
   - Vue Router
   - Vuetify for UI components
   - Axios for HTTP requests

3. Database:
   - MongoDB

4. Message Broker:
   - Apache ActiveMQ

5. DevOps:
   - Docker and Docker Compose
   - Nginx as reverse proxy
   - GitLab CI/CD for automation

Key Features:
1. Manage JMS Connections (Consumers and Producers)
2. Send and receive JMS messages
3. Real-time updates using WebSockets
4. Dark mode toggle
5. RESTful API with Swagger documentation

Project Structure:
1. Backend:
   - Models: JMSConnection, JMSMessage
   - Repositories: JMSConnectionRepository, JMSMessageRepository
   - Services: JMSConnectionService, MessageService
   - Controllers: JMSConnectionController, MessageController
   - Config: SwaggerConfig, WebSocketConfig
   - Tests: Unit tests for services, integration tests for controllers

2. Frontend:
   - Views: Consumers, Producers
   - Components: ConnectionList, MessageList, MessageForm
   - Vuex Store: Managing application state and API calls
   - Router: Handling navigation between views

3. Docker:
   - Dockerfiles for backend and frontend
   - docker-compose.yml for orchestrating services

4. Nginx:
   - Configuration for reverse proxy and serving static files

Development Workflow:
1. Backend development using Spring Boot and MongoDB
2. Frontend development using Vue.js and Vuetify
3. Local testing with Docker Compose
4. Continuous Integration and Deployment with GitLab CI/CD

Testing Strategy:
1. Backend:
   - Unit tests for services using JUnit and Mockito
   - Integration tests for controllers using Spring's MockMvc
   - TestContainers for integration tests with real MongoDB and ActiveMQ instances
2. Frontend:
   - Unit tests for Vue components (to be implemented)

Deployment:
- Containerized deployment using Docker
- Nginx as a reverse proxy and for serving static frontend files
- Scalable architecture with separate backend and frontend containers
